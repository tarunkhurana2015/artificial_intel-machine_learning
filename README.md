# Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focues on the develoment of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from expreience, without being explicitly programmed.
The core idea is to allow computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions based on that learning.

## Key concepts in ML
1. **Data**: Data is the foundation of ML. It can come in various forms, such as text, images, audio or structured data like spreadsheets. The quality and quntity of data greatly infulence the performance of a machine learning model.
2. **Features**: Featuresaretheindividualmeasurablepropertiesorcharacteristicsof the data that are used as input for machine learning algorithms. For example, in an image recognition task, the pixel values of an image could be the features.
3. **Algorithms**: Machinelearningalgorithmsarethemathematicalmodelsor procedures used to learn patterns and relationships from data. These algorithms can be classified into different categories based on their learning style, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
4. **Training**: Trainingamachinelearningmodelinvolvesfeedingitwithlabeleddata (in supervised learning) or unlabeled data (in unsupervised learning), allowing the model to learn the underlying patterns. During training, the model adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual outcomes.
5. **Evaluation**: Aftertraining,theperformanceofamachinelearningmodelneedsto be evaluated using separate test data to assess how well it generalizes to new, unseen data. Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), among others.
6. **Deployment**: Onceamachinelearningmodelhasbeentrainedandevaluated,it can be deployed to make predictions or decisions on new data in real-world applications. Deployment involves integrating the model into existing systems or platforms where it can be utilized.

Machine learning has numerous applications across various domains, including but not limited to:

● Image and speech recognition

● Natural language processing (NLP)

● Recommendation systems

● Predictive analytics

● Autonomous vehicles

● Healthcare (e.g., disease diagnosis)

● Finance (e.g., fraud detection)

Overall, machine learning has the potential to revolutionize industries by automating tasks, extracting valuable insights from data, and enabling intelligent decision-making systems.
